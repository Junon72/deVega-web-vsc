# deVega web

This website landing page proposal was created for the milestone project, as a part of the Full Stack Developer study program of Code Institute. 

The web design is made for freelance choreographer Jesus de Vega, based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Besides choreographing de Vega is increasingly extending his practice to other disciplines on the art field, especially to the area of music. His current interest is to explore the merging of movement and sound as a facilitator of a creative process.

Besides his artistic work, he is in process of developing a business proposal based on his artistic practices. This could entail some form of consultation services for businesses in creative industries, and teaching tools for creative thinking and creative processes in various business environments.

 
## UX

The web sites de Vega needs have clearly two distinct purposes and audiences, for which reason the web design is divided in two distinct branches as well. The first landing page in the proposal gives the visitor an option to either enter the pages focusing on the de Vega's artistic work or the pages for his business. Since the business side is currently under development and not completely formalized, this design focuses solely on the web pages for de Vega's art.

The main purpose of the web pages is to give information for the visitors about the diversity of de Vega's work on the areas of dance, Performing Arts, experimental music and Visual Arts. The potential visitors are also expected to represent a diversity of interests and reasons for their visit.

On a longer term, the website would also serve as an exhibition place and a digital art gallery for short digital art works/ creations in the future.

### Examples of potential visitors to the artistic pages and their needs:

1. Visitor looking for information about latest projects. This could be audience, potential collaborators or promotors. They would be interested to see material from the works in from of text, images, sound and video. They might also look for some kind of calendar and or information of upcoming events.

    Usertype 1.:

    As a vistor type 1. I want to know what de Vega ahs been busy with lately and if there are perfromances or events to attend to.

2. Visitors interested in de Vegas artistic work in general. They would be looking for material from a longer period of time; articles, visual material and information about the collaborators (organizations and people), producers and so forth. Also, they might be interested in de Vega's personal history, background, interests, inspirations, location etc.

    Usertype 2.:

    As a visitor type 2. I would like to see images and videos of de Vega's works from now, but also from the past, and get an idea of variety of things he is making and involved with. 

3. Visitors looking to get in contact, such as promotors or collaborators.

    Usertype 3.:

    As a vistor type 3. I would like to get in touch with de Vega.
        a. to invite his work to perfom on venue I am working for.
        b. to promote my own work and suggest a collaboration

### The page structure, content and how the pages intend to answer the needs of the above mentioned users:

Note: Within the scope of the project, only some parts of the site are finished and the site does not include all planned content and functions.

After the first lanidng page, the visitor who has selected the Art option (in place of Business) arrives to the home page of the art branch of the website. Each section is designed to have a distinct role in relation to the user needs and the needs and wishes expressed by de Vega.

The pages are scrolling and divided in five separate sections:

1. Actual
    -  contains a 'poster' images with titles and short descriptions of ongoing projects, with a link to dedicated pages with more material, including videos, images and informative text. 

    The page is directed to type 1. user needs, who is looking for information about what is happening at the moment.

2. Gallery
    - contains a short promotional text and some interactive visual element to invite the user to visit the digtial gallery.
        - this section has no content at the moment, only a background image to demarcate the section, give an idea of the planned color schema and layout. The background image in future is planned to be incorporated with some kind of interactive visual element promoting the gallery.

        The page is directed to type 2. and 3. user needs, who are interested of de Vega's work more broadly. 

3. Archive
    - contains some selection of the archive material, 'teasers', to invite the user to visit the archived material from de Vega's previous projects and works.
        - this section as well is curently without content. A background image is provided to demarcate the section and to give an idea of the eventual layout and color schema.

       The page is directed to type 2. and 3. user needs, who are interested of de Vega's work more broadly.


4. About
    - contains personal information of de Vega, his background, interest, inspiration and where he is based.

    The page is directed to users in general, who are interested of de Vega's background and more personal information.

5. Contact
    - contains a face image of de Vega with an invitation text to contact and a contact from. Moreover, the page provides a link to a downloadable pdf of de Vegaâ€™s C.V.

     The page is directed to type 3. user needs, who are seeking to get in contact with de Vega.

### About the visual design:

1. The design intends to tell a story through the background images, which provide an atmosphere, focus, color schema and compositional elements for the layout, and text used in the dividing elements between the main sections.
The story is simultaniously revealing and hiding, informative and mysterious. It is meant to avoke curiosity and provide a pleasing and easy environment to navigate and to find what the user might be looking for. 

2. The use of full page background images and half page layouts give the pages more artistic and slightly editorial feel, making a clear separation to the more sober visual world planned for the business pages. 

3. The font-family was selected together with de Vega. The font in the logo is replacing an original font used in de Vega's current webpages logo. The original is not available free of charge.

4. The font colors are derived from the colors of the original logo. To improve the contrast and readability, the title and links are slightly more vibrant tone than the logo.

5. Navigationbar is minimized, and together with the logo used as one of the binding visual elements through the pages. Other binding elements are the used colors in the general repeating elements, such as the titles and links.
